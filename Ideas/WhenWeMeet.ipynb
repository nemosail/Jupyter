I can't tell why. But it is true, it is not a dream, or it is a dream that I can't and don't want to wake up. Glad to meet you, glad that I said hello world to you, Miss Ren. I know that I am terrible at making girls happy. I still don't know how to be with you, how to stay  with you. But I won't fool you, hurt you. I am real and virtuous. Because that is what I always am. I was, I am, I will be. I still have many things to learn, for you, for me, for us. I know that I am stupid somehow, but please don't get mad at me and tell me and guide me, stay with me... It is cold outside, but warm inside. A little bit old outside, but young inside. Kissed you for real from heart. May we rest in a long deep dreamless slumber...\n",
